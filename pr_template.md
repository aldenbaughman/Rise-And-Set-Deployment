## Requirements
Please check off which features you have implemented:
- [X] A catchy name and title with a cool font!
- [X] An interactive, pretty world map that spans most of the home page, using the [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) library.
- [X] An [event](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/example-events/) that places a marker at your current location with a popup that displays the sunrise and sunset times of your location using the [Sunrise Sunset JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sunrise-sunset-js) library.
- [X] The popup should also display information about a place in a totally different part of the world with similar sunrise and sunset times. You should use the Google Gemini API for this, leveraging both system instructions and your individual queries to get the best result possible.
- [X] A separate history page that keeps track of locations you've tapped. This should include latitude, longitude, and some information about Google Gemini's response. You can include the whole response if you want, but making another call to Google Gemini to extract just the location to put on there would be extra cool! You can display this information in whatever format you want. Make sure you can get between your home and history pages by clicking on an icon, text, etc.
- [ ] Deploy the frontend and backend if you can using some of the free deployment tools we talked about in the workshops!

## Written Portion
1. **How did the project go? What parts of it did you most enjoy / find yourself good at?**

Beginning this project, I felt a little overwhelmed by the assignments, but as soon as I got the hang of things I ended up really enjoying this project. I found the process of looking through documentation and putting together a bunch of different parts to make the website function very satisfying. I really enjoyed working with both the frontend and backend, as well as designing the website with css even though I thought it would be my least favorite part.

2. **Was this technical assessment what you expected? If you had another two weeks to work on it, what would you add or change?**

If I had another two weeks to work on it, I would fix the useState issue where the locations and coordinates are a couple clicks behind the marker, make the history a seperate page (I tried desperatly to do this but the simple soultions I tried didnt work), actually delpoy the website, add the ability to returing to a previous coordinate by clicking on one of the boxes in the history part, add a search bar so you can search locations and the map with move to its respective lat/long coordiates and tell you its sunset/rise times, and generally clean up the ui and make it look more professional.
